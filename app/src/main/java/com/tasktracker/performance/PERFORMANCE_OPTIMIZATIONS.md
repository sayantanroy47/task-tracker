# Performance Optimizations Summary

This document outlines all the performance optimizations implemented in the Task Tracker app.

## Database Optimizations

### 1. Query Optimization
- Added proper database indexes on frequently queried columns (`is_completed`, `reminder_time`, `created_at`)
- Implemented pagination support with `PagingSource` for large datasets
- Added limited queries for quick previews (`getActiveTasksLimited`, `getCompletedTasksLimited`)
- Optimized reminder queries with time range filtering
- Added bulk operations for better performance (`bulkUpdateTaskCompletion`)

### 2. Database Configuration
- Enabled Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for better concurrency
- Added query callback for performance monitoring
- Enabled multi-instance invalidation for consistency

### 3. Connection Management
- Implemented proper database connection pooling
- Added query timeout configurations
- Optimized database initialization

## UI Performance Optimizations

### 1. Compose Optimizations
- Added `key` parameter to LazyColumn items for better recycling
- Implemented `contentType` for improved item recycling
- Used `derivedStateOf` to prevent unnecessary recompositions
- Added `remember` for stable callbacks
- Implemented `animateItemPlacement` for smooth animations
- Used `LazyListState` to maintain scroll position

### 2. Memory Management
- Implemented proper lifecycle handling in ViewModels
- Added job cancellation to prevent memory leaks
- Used `distinctUntilChanged` to reduce unnecessary emissions
- Implemented proper Flow operators (`flowOn`, `catch`)

### 3. Large List Handling
