üîß COMMON ISSUES:

1. "Flutter not found"
   - Install Flutter from: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
   - Add Flutter to your PATH environment variable
   - Restart PowerShell after installation

2. "No connected devices"
   - For web: Use option 1 (runs in Chrome browser)
   - For Windows: Use option 2 (desktop app)
   - For Android: Connect device or start Android emulator

3. "Build failed"
   - Run "flutter doctor" to check setup
   - Try "flutter clean" then "flutter pub get"
   - Check that you have the latest Flutter version

4. "Dependency issues"
   - Make sure you have internet connection
   - Try deleting pubspec.lock and running "flutter pub get"
