# Task Tracker - Complete Notification System Implementation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the notification system implementation for the Task Tracker app, completed as part of Phase 3.1 of the project roadmap.

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ 1. Local Notification Setup
- **FlutterNotificationService**: Complete implementation using `flutter_local_notifications`
- **Cross-platform support**: iOS and Android notification handling
- **Permission management**: Automatic permission requests and status checking
- **Timezone support**: Precise scheduling with timezone awareness

### ✅ 2. Smart Reminder System
- **Multiple intervals**: Support for 1hr, 6hrs, 12hrs, and 1-day reminder intervals
- **User preferences**: Configurable default reminder times via settings
- **Quiet hours**: Do Not Disturb functionality with customizable time ranges
- **Persistence**: Settings persist across app restarts via SQLite storage

### ✅ 3. Notification Actions
- **Android actions**: Complete, Snooze, and Reschedule buttons with custom icons
- **iOS categories**: Notification categories with action buttons
- **Background handling**: Proper handling of notification responses when app is closed
- **Task integration**: Actions directly modify task state and reschedule notifications

### ✅ 4. Notification Management
- **Settings screen**: Comprehensive UI for all notification preferences
- **Real-time updates**: Settings changes immediately affect notification behavior
- **Effective settings**: Notifications respect quiet hours and priority levels
- **Cleanup**: Automatic cancellation when tasks are completed or deleted

## Architecture Overview

### Core Components

1. **NotificationService Interface** (`lib/core/services/notification_service.dart`)
   - Abstract interface defining notification operations
   - Platform-agnostic API for scheduling and managing notifications

2. **FlutterNotificationService** (`lib/core/services/flutter_notification_service.dart`)
   - Concrete implementation using flutter_local_notifications
   - Platform-specific configuration for Android and iOS
   - Integration with user preferences for adaptive behavior

3. **TaskNotificationManager** (`lib/core/services/task_notification_manager.dart`)
   - High-level task-notification integration
   - Handles scheduling, cancellation, and rescheduling of task reminders
   - Manages notification actions (complete, snooze, reschedule)

4. **NotificationPreferencesService** (`lib/core/services/notification_preferences_service.dart`)
   - SQLite-based storage for user notification preferences
   - CRUD operations for notification settings
   - Effective settings calculation considering quiet hours

### Data Models

1. **NotificationPreferences** (`lib/shared/models/notification_preferences.dart`)
   - Complete user preference model
   - Quiet hours with time range support
   - Priority levels and behavioral settings

2. **EffectiveNotificationSettings**
   - Runtime settings considering current time and quiet hours
   - Platform-specific priority mapping

### User Interface

1. **NotificationSettingsScreen** (`lib/features/settings/notification_settings_screen.dart`)
   - Comprehensive settings UI with 6 main sections:
     - Permission status and warnings
     - Basic settings (enable, sound, vibration, badge)
     - Default reminder intervals configuration
     - Quiet hours setup with time pickers
     - Advanced settings (lock screen, priority)
     - Reset functionality

2. **Settings Integration**
   - Added notification settings link to main settings screen
   - Go Router integration for proper navigation

### State Management

1. **Riverpod Providers** (`lib/shared/providers/notification_providers.dart`)
   - NotificationPreferencesNotifier for reactive settings management
   - EffectiveNotificationSettingsProvider for current state
   - Integration with app-wide state management

## Platform-Specific Features

### Android
- **Notification Channel**: "Task Reminders" channel with proper importance levels
- **Action Icons**: Custom drawable resources (ic_check.xml, ic_snooze.xml)
- **Exact Alarms**: Uses `exactAllowWhileIdle` for precise timing
- **Visibility Control**: Respects lock screen preferences

### iOS
- **Notification Categories**: "task_reminder" category with action buttons
- **Interruption Levels**: Maps priority to iOS interruption levels (passive, active, timeSensitive, critical)
- **Action Configuration**: Proper foreground/background action handling
- **Permission Granularity**: Separate control for alerts, badges, and sounds

## Key Features

### 1. Intelligent Scheduling
- Notifications only scheduled if enabled in preferences
- Automatic skip during quiet hours (unless urgent priority)
- Timezone-aware scheduling using `tz.TZDateTime`
- Efficient notification ID generation to avoid conflicts

### 2. User Experience
- Permission warning cards with direct enable buttons
- Real-time preference updates without app restart
- Comprehensive time picker dialogs for quiet hours
- Visual feedback for all setting changes

### 3. Do Not Disturb Integration
- Customizable quiet hours with start/end times
- Support for overnight quiet periods (e.g., 10 PM - 7 AM)
- Priority-based interruption allowances
- Independent sound/vibration control during quiet hours

### 4. Notification Actions
```dart
// Android Actions
AndroidNotificationAction('complete', 'Complete', ...)
AndroidNotificationAction('snooze', 'Snooze', ...)
AndroidNotificationAction('reschedule', 'Reschedule', ...)

// iOS Actions
DarwinNotificationAction.plain('complete', 'Complete', ...)
DarwinNotificationAction.plain('snooze', 'Snooze', ...)
DarwinNotificationAction.plain('reschedule', 'Reschedule', ...)
```

### 5. Database Integration
- Preferences stored in `notification_preferences` table
- JSON serialization for complex preference objects
- Automatic migration and default value insertion
- Efficient querying with SQLite indexes

## Usage Examples

### Scheduling Task Reminders
```dart
final taskNotificationManager = ref.read(taskNotificationManagerProvider);
await taskNotificationManager.scheduleTaskReminders(task);
```

### Updating Preferences
```dart
final notificationPrefs = ref.read(notificationPreferencesProvider.notifier);
await notificationPrefs.setQuietHours(
  enabled: true,
  startTime: TimeOfDayQuiet(hour: 22, minute: 0),
  endTime: TimeOfDayQuiet(hour: 7, minute: 0),
);
```

### Handling Notification Actions
```dart
// Automatically handled by TaskNotificationManager
taskNotificationManager.initializeActionHandlers();
```

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Notifications appear at scheduled times
- [ ] Action buttons work correctly (Complete, Snooze, Reschedule)
- [ ] Quiet hours are respected
- [ ] Settings persist across app restarts
- [ ] Permission handling works on both platforms
- [ ] Notifications are cancelled when tasks are completed

### Integration Testing
- Service initialization during app startup
- Cross-platform permission handling
- Settings screen navigation and updates
- Notification scheduling and cancellation

## Performance Considerations

1. **Efficient Storage**: JSON serialization for complex preferences
2. **Batch Operations**: Minimize database transactions
3. **Memory Management**: Singleton services with proper lifecycle
4. **Background Processing**: Minimal processing during notification actions

## Security & Privacy

1. **Local Storage**: All preferences stored locally in SQLite
2. **No External Services**: No remote notification dependencies
3. **Permission Respect**: Strict adherence to user permission choices
4. **Data Integrity**: Proper validation and error handling

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Notifications**: AI-based optimal notification timing
2. **Location-Based**: Geofencing for location-aware reminders
3. **Wearable Support**: Integration with smartwatches
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Notification engagement tracking
5. **Custom Sounds**: User-selectable notification tones
