# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important Steps

You always spawn multiple agents. You are allowed to spawn any number of agents you want or even choose from the agents I have. Agents are located in .claude\agents

# Planning 
When a SPEC is planned, divide it into steps, update the .claude\specs\@TASKS.md file. Follow the @TASKS.md file and always keep it updated after finishing a task.

# TODOs
When you are skipping some implementation, add this is the .claude\specs\@TODO.md File for future reference and implementation.

# FEATURE_IDEAS

When I ask you about a feature idea, or you come up with a new idea /feature, add it to .claude\specs\@IDEAS.md
