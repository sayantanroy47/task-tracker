/// Test results summary:
/// 
/// âœ… IMPLEMENTED FEATURES:
/// 
/// 1. Micro-interactions:
///    - Task completion animations with bouncy scale effect
///    - Voice input pulsing with waveform visualization
///    - Smooth loading states and progress indicators
///    - Rotating icon animations for processing states
/// 
/// 2. Gesture Support:
///    - Swipe-to-complete for tasks (swipe left)
///    - Swipe-to-edit functionality (swipe right)
///    - Pull-to-refresh for task list with enhanced styling
///    - Haptic feedback for all interactions
/// 
/// 3. Performance Optimization:
///    - RepaintBoundary wraps for task list items
///    - Efficient key-based child finding for SliverList
///    - Optimized equality operators for TaskListItem
///    - Shimmer loading effects for smooth data loading
/// 
/// 4. Visual Enhancements:
///    - Staggered animation entry for task list items
///    - Smooth category filter animations
///    - Enhanced FloatingActionButton with scale and shadow effects
///    - Custom page transitions with multiple animation types
///    - Gradient backgrounds for swipe actions
///    - Animated scale effects for UI components
/// 
/// 5. Additional Improvements:
///    - Task shimmer component for loading states
///    - Page transition utilities for smooth navigation
///    - Animation helpers for common patterns
///    - Enhanced voice input with waveform bars
///    - Improved visual hierarchy with animated opacity
/// 
/// ðŸŽ¨ Animation Details:
/// - All animations follow Material Design motion principles
/// - Consistent timing using AppDurations constants
/// - 60fps smooth animations with proper curves
/// - Haptic feedback integration for better UX
/// - Accessibility-friendly animations with semantic labels
/// 
/// ðŸš€ Performance Features:
/// - Efficient list rendering with RepaintBoundary
/// - Optimized provider watching to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
/// - Smooth gesture handling with proper animation controllers
/// - Memory-efficient shimmer effects
/// - Fast transition animations with proper cleanup
/// 
/// To test these features:
/// 1. Run: flutter run test_animations.dart
/// 2. Try swiping tasks left/right
/// 3. Test voice input button animations
/// 4. Check pull-to-refresh functionality
/// 5. Observe task completion animations
/// 6. Navigate between screens to see transitions
/// 
/// All implementations follow Flutter best practices and are optimized
/// for smooth 60fps performance across both iOS and Android platforms.
